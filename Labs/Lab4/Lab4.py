# In this lab we will determine
# the minimum mass required for the LMC so that it maintains the observed radius 
# in the face of the Milky Way's tidal field. 

# # Part A
# 
# We define the mass profile of the Milky Way using a Hernquist profile.
# 
# 
# $\rho(r) =  \frac{M_{halo}}{2\pi} \frac{h_a}{r(r+h_a)^3} \qquad M(r) =  \frac{M_{halo} r^2}{(h_a+r)^2}$ 
# 
# 

# ## #1
# 
# Create a function `hernquist_mass` that returns the dark matter halo mass at a given radius in units of solar mass.
# This function should take as input:  the distance from the Galactic center $r$, the scale radius $h_a$, and the halo mass $M_{halo}$.
# 
# 
# For the Hernquist scale radius for the Milky Way, use the default value of $h_a=60$ kpc. 
# 
# For $M_{halo}$ use your answer for the total mass of the simulated Milky Way you computed in Homework 3 as the default value (in units of 1e12).
